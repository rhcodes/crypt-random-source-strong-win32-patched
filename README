NAME
    Crypt::Random::Source::Strong::Win32 - Get random data from the Windows
    API.

SYNOPSIS
     use Crypt::Random::Source::Strong::Win32;
     my $p = Crypt::Random::Source::Strong::Win32->new;
     my $data = $p->get(1024);

DESCRIPTION
    This is a source of random data that uses the RtlGenRandom function on
    Windows XP and above, and CryptGenRandom on Windows 2000.

    This is considered to be a strong source of random data, as the
    CryptGenRandom function, which is backed by RtlGenRandom, is documented
    as being a strong source of random data.

    If you are on Windows, this is the recommended way of getting random
    data.

METHODS
    The same as Crypt::Random::Source::Base. There is no need to seed this
    source.
